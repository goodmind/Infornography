Priorities: [H High] [M Medium] [L Low]
Subcases can be represented with indentation.
I'll also create issues of these tasks on the central repository.

[H]: Display system RAM usage and total.
[H]: Display USER, HOST, SHELL, TERM, perhaps any other easily accessible env. variables.
[H]: Add a cute ASCII picture of Lain.
	[M]: Test said ASCII picture in different environments.
	[M]: Add the option to disable escape codes if needed.
