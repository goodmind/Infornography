Priorities: [H High] [M Medium] [L Low]
Subcases can be represented with indentation.
I'll also create issues of these tasks on the central repository.

[H]: Display system RAM usage and total.
		 - Done on GNU/Linux.
		 - Needs implementing on OSX and FreeBSD with vmstat.
[L]: Color support.
		 - If this is going to be a mess on each platform, forget about it.
